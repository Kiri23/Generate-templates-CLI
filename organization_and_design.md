Here's a brief explanation of the directories and files in the project structure:

- `bin/` directory: This directory contains the main entry point for the CLI application, which is the cli-template-generator.js file. This file is responsible for initializing the application and parsing command-line arguments using the commander package.
- `lib/ directory`: This directory contains the main codebase for the CLI application. It is organized into subdirectories to separate concerns and maintain readability.
  - `commands/` directory: This directory contains modules for each command that the user can run. Each module exports a function that is executed when the user runs the corresponding command. For example, the add.js module is executed when the user runs the add command, and the select.js module is executed when the user runs the select command.
  - `config/` directory: This directory contains configuration files for the CLI application. The templates.js file contains the logic for managing templates and the location of the templates directory.
  - `helpers/` directory: This directory contains utility modules that are used throughout the application. The download.js module contains functions for downloading templates from a remote repository. The spinner.js module contains functions for displaying a loading spinner. The templates.js module contains functions for managing templates.
  - `index.js` file: This file is the main entry point for the lib/ directory. It exports a single function that is called by the cli-template-generator.js file.
- `templates/` directory: This directory contains the project templates. Each template is organized into a subdirectory based on the project type. The template.json file in each subdirectory contains metadata about the template, such as the name and description.
- `package.json` file: This file contains metadata about the CLI application, including its name, version, dependencies, and scripts.
- `README.md` file: This file contains documentation for the CLI application

## Design Pattern
For the design pattern, the CLI application can use a `command pattern`. 

The command pattern separates the logic for **different commands into separate modules**, making the codebase easier to manage and maintain.
Each command module should export a function that is executed when the user runs the corresponding command. For example, the select.js module exports a function that is executed when the user runs the select command. The function should take any necessary arguments as parameters and perform the logic for the command.

The index.js file should use the commander package to parse command-line arguments and execute the corresponding command module. for example if the user runs the `add` command, the index.js file should execute the add.js module.
